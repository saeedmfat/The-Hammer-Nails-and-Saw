## üöÄ Introduction

This repository is a practical learning resource for DevOps engineers and Python developers. Each project is a self-contained script focusing on a hard-to-very-hard task that mimics real-life automation, infrastructure, and monitoring problems. The goal is to master the foundational tools that power more complex frameworks.

**Core Libraries Used:**
- `os` & `subprocess`: Interfacing with the operating system.
- `requests`: Interacting with web APIs and services.
- `PyYAML`: Working with configuration and manifest files.
